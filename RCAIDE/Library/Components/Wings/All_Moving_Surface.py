class All_Moving_Surface(Component):
    """ This class is used to allow every all-moving control surface class
    (e.g. Stabilator) to inherit from both a type of Wing (Horizontal_Tail
    in the case of a Stabilator) and this class. This, way All_Moving_Surface
    subclasses can inherit necessary functionality without code bloat or 
    lengthy type checking if-statements.
    
    In general, this class should not be used directly, and should only exist
    as one of the parents of another class that also inherits from Wing

        Attributes also found in Control_Surface:
            see Control_Surface().__defaults__ for an explanation of attributes. Any
            attributes used by this class that are shared with Control_Surface should 
            always adhere to the convention established in Control_Surface.py
    
        Attributes unique to All_Moving_Surface:
        - use_constant_hinge_fraction: false by default. If this is true, the hinge vector 
            will follow a constant chord_fraction allong the wing, regardless of what is set
            for hinge_vector. Note that constant hinge fractions are how hinges are handled for 
            Control_Surfaces. If this attribute is false, the hinge vector is described by
            the hinge_vector attribute
        - hinge_vector: The vector in body-frame that the hingeline points along. By default, 
            it is [0,0,0], and this is taken to mean that the hinge line is normal to the root
            chord, in-plane with the wing. This attribute does nothing if use_constant_hinge_fraction
            is set to True.
